// Q: 15
// Title:
// L2 - Preventing Stack Overflow in Recursion

// Problem Statement:
// You are required to write a recursive function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given number. However, you also need to handle potential stack overflow issues by adding a check to prevent an infinite recursion in case of incorrect input or base cases. Specifically, ensure that:

// If the input number is negative, print "Invalid input".
// If the input is not a number, print "Invalid input".
// Use recursion to compute the factorial for valid inputs.
// Include a base case to stop the recursion at factorial(0).
// You will implement a safety mechanism that prevents a stack overflow by avoiding incorrect recursive calls.

// Steps:

// Write a function factorial that calculates the factorial of a number.
// Make sure that you read about Recursion in MDN (it's an interesting topics).
// Include checks for negative numbers and non-numeric input.
// Use recursion with a base case to avoid stack overflow.
// Test with multiple inputs to demonstrate correctness and safety.

function factorial(n){
  if(typeof n!='number' || n<0){
    
    return `Invalid Input`;
  }

  if(n===1 || n===0)
    return n;

  return n * factorial(n-1);
}

console.log(factorial("5"));
