//L0 - Understanding Synchronous Code Execution

//Write a JavaScript program that demonstrates synchronous code execution. You should create three console logs that print "Task 1", "Task 2", and "Task 3" in sequence. Since synchronous code runs line-by-line, the console output should display each task in the order they are written.


console.log("Task 1");
console.log("Task 2");
console.log("Task 3");
